# File Organizer Project

## 🗂️ Project Overview

This **File Organizer** is a Node.js script that helps you easily organize files into separate folders based on their type (e.g., Images, Documents, Videos). Whether you're dealing with a large number of files in a single folder or need a simple way to categorize files, this tool automates the process.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Node.js** for file system operations
- **JavaScript** for logic and control flow

## 📝 Features

- Organize files by type (Images, Documents, Videos)
- Supports multiple file formats
- Automatic folder creation for organized files
- Optional: Copy files instead of moving them

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shivamshrivaastava/file-system-organizer.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd file-organizer
    ```
3. Create a folder, e.g., `test_folder`, and add unorganized files to it.

4. Run the script:
    ```bash
    node fileOrganizer.js
    ```

After running the script, your files will be organized into respective folders like `Images`, `Documents`, and `Videos`.
## 🛠️ How It Works

The script categorizes files based on their file extensions:

- **Images**: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`
- **Documents**: `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.doc`
- **Videos**: `.mp4`, `.mkv`

Folders like `Images`, `Documents`, and `Videos` are created automatically, and files are moved or copied to the corresponding subfolders.
